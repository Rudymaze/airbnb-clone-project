OVERVIEW:

# Airbnb Clone

A full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, enabling users to browse, book, and list rental properties.

## üéØ **Goals**

- Replicate core Airbnb features: property listings, search/filters, bookings, and user authentication.
- Prioritize responsive UI, seamless navigation, and secure payments.
- Demonstrate scalable full-stack development with modern tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js (OAuth via Google/GitHub)
- **Payments**: Stripe API
- **Maps**: Mapbox/Google Maps API
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

# UI/UX Design Planning

## **Design Goals**

- Intuitive Navigation: Users should effortlessly browse, filter, and book properties.

- Visual Consistency: Clean, modern aesthetics with Airbnb-inspired layouts.

- Mobile-First: Fully responsive across devices.

- Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines (contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels).

# Key Features to Implement

- Interactive maps with property pins

- High-quality image carousels for listings

- Instant search/filter (dates, price, amenities)

- Clear CTAs (e.g., "Book Now") and minimal steps for checkout

- Real-time booking availability updates

## Why User-Friendly Design Matters

**A seamless UI/UX is critical for**:

- Trust: Clear information and smooth flows reduce user anxiety (e.g., during payments).

- Conversion: Fewer steps = higher booking rates.

- Retention: Intuitive navigation encourages repeat usage.

# Why Design Properties Matter

**Visual Harmony**
Prevents style conflicts and ensures cohesive brand presentation across all components.

**Development Handoff**
Provides exact specifications (hex codes, font weights) for accurate implementation.

**Accessibility Compliance**
Guarantees proper contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text) and readable typography.

**Design Scalability**
Establishes reusable tokens that can be expanded for new features.

**Performance Optimization**
Standardized typography scales reduce render-heavy style recalculations.

**Team Efficiency**
Eliminates guesswork with documented rules for spacing, colors, and text hierarchy.
